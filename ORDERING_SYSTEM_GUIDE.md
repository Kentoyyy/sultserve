# 🍽️ Ordering System Integration Guide

## ✅ **Fixed: Real Cashier Integration**

The ordering modal is now properly connected to the cashier system instead of being automatic. Here's how it works:

### **🔄 Order Flow:**

1. **Customer Places Order** (via Ordering Modal)
   - Select products and add to cart
   - Choose payment method
   - Click "Place Order"
   - Order is created in database with status: `pending`

2. **Cashier Manages Order** (via Cashier Dashboard)
   - Order appears in cashier dashboard
   - Cashier can change status: `pending` → `confirmed` → `preparing` → `ready` → `completed`
   - All status changes are logged in activity logs

3. **Customer Tracks Order** (via Ordering Modal)
   - Real-time status updates every 3 seconds
   - Shows current order status from cashier
   - Automatic updates without page refresh

### **📊 Order Statuses:**

- **`pending`** - Order received, waiting for cashier confirmation
- **`confirmed`** - Cashier confirmed the order
- **`preparing`** - Order is being prepared
- **`ready`** - Order is ready for pickup
- **`completed`** - Order completed
- **`cancelled`** - Order cancelled by cashier

### **🧪 How to Test:**

1. **Open Landing Page** - Click "Order Now" to open modal
2. **Add Products** - Select items and add to cart
3. **Place Order** - Complete checkout process
4. **Check Cashier Dashboard** - Order should appear in pending status
5. **Update Status** - Use cashier dashboard to change order status
6. **Watch Updates** - Ordering modal will show real-time status changes

### **🔧 Technical Details:**

- **Database Integration**: Orders are stored in PostgreSQL
- **Real-time Updates**: Polling every 3 seconds for status changes
- **Inventory Management**: Automatic stock deduction when orders are placed
- **Activity Logging**: All order actions are logged for audit trail
- **Error Handling**: Proper error messages and fallbacks

### **💡 Key Features:**

- ✅ **White card overlay** on landing page
- ✅ **Real order creation** in database
- ✅ **Cashier-controlled** order management
- ✅ **Real-time status updates** from cashier
- ✅ **Complete order tracking** with visual indicators
- ✅ **Inventory integration** with automatic stock updates

The system now works exactly like a real restaurant ordering system where the cashier has full control over order status, and customers can track their orders in real-time!
